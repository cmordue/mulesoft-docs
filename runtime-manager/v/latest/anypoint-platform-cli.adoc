= Command Line Interface Shell for Anypoint Platform.
:keywords: administration, api, organization, users, gateway, theme, cli

Anypoint Platform provides you a command line tool to interact with your Cloudhub applications, link:/runtime-manager/virtual-private-cloud[VPCs] and link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-dedicated-load-balancer[Cloudhub load balancers] through both interactive shell and standard CLI modes.

== Assumptions

This document assumes that you are familiar with our link:/api-manager/tutorials[API Manager Tutorials] and that you are able to link:/api-manager/managing-your-api[manage your API using Anypoint Platform].

== Installation

[IMPORTANT]
First you need to make sure you have the node.js runtime environment installed in your machine. Along with it, you'll need to use node's default package manager (npm) to be able to install Anypoint-CLI.
Following the steps in the link:https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node[node documentation] will help you get both resources.

You can install Anypoint-CLI using node's default package manager by typing in your console

[source,bash]
----
$ npm install -g anypoint-cli
----

If you already have Anypoint CLI running on your machine, you can get the latest version by running

[source,bash]
----
$ npm update -g anypoint-cli
----

[NOTE]
Depending on the configuration of your system, you might have to run these commands using administrator`s credentials.


== Usage

Every instance of Anypoint-CLI takes any of the following parameters:

[width="100a",cols="15,75a,10a",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter |Description| Required
|username | Your Anypoint Platform username. +
You can also use an environment variable (e.g. `export ANYPOINT_USERNAME=<name>`)| *Yes*
|password | Your Anypoint Platform password. +
You can also use an environment variable (e.g. `export ANYPOINT_PASSWORD=<pwd>`)| *Yes*
|organization| Your organization within Anypoint Platform. +
You can also use an environment variable (e.g. `export ANYPOINT_ORG=<name>`)| No
|environment| Your Anypoint-CLI environment. +
You can also use an environment variable (e.g. `export ANYPOINT_ENV=<name>`)| No
|===

=== Logging In

As instructed above, the username and password parameters are required. However, if you choose to simply pass your username, Anypoint Platform CLI prompts for your password.

If you choose to pass the credentials when running Anypoint-CLI, we strongly recommend to pass both parameters as environment variables: +
`$ANYPOINT_USERNAME` and `$ANYPOINT_PASSWORD`.

The recommended way of passing your credentials is using the `credentials` file located in the `~/.anypoint/` directory in Linux and OSx or `C:\Users\USERNAME \.anypoint\` in Windows. +

[NOTE]
The `/.anypoint/` directory is not automatically created during installation, so you need to create it in the user's directory of your corresponding system.

Set up a blank file named `credentials` with the following structure:

[source,credentials,linenums]
----
{
 "default": {
  "username": "yourAnypointUserName",
  "password": "yourAnypointPassword"
 },
 "otherProfile": {
  "username": "",
  "password": "",
  "organization": "",
  "environment": "",
  "host": ""
 }
}
----

Environment variables override credentials file parameters and Command line parameters override environment variables. +
If you donÂ´t pass a command line paramter, the default profile properties are used. 

[IMPORTANT]
--
A few considerations to keep in mind while using Anypoint-CLI:

. If you don't set an environment, you will be automatically sent to `production`. +
. Your Anypoint session won't expire if you are accessing through this command line interface. +
. Anypoint-CLI works with autocomplete. You can start typing the name of the command or parameter and hit `tab` for an autocomplete, or double tap `tab` for a list of all possible options.
--

Once you have your parameters in order, you can pass commands. +
